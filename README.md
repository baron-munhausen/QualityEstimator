# QualityEstimator
**QualityEstimator** is a part of master's work of three students. We don't know why we must write this program, but we do it.

**QualityEstimator** designed for compare two images: segmented by expert and segmented by automatic segmentation algorithms.
Comparsion is in three metric spaces: Gromov-Frechet, Hausdorf and Gromov-Hausdorf. It produce high precision results based
on those three metrics.

***We don't know will be the results of our work in use but we do it!*** Because, do the master's work never late!
